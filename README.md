# pyqrack
Pure Python bindings for the pure C++11/OpenCL Qrack quantum computer simulator library

(**PyQrack** is just pure Qrack.)

**IMPORTANT**: You must build and install [vm6502q/qrack](https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack) to use this.

(This barrier to usage will be removed, shortly.)

Import and instantiate [`QrackSimulator`](https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack/blob/main/pyqrack/qrack_simulator.py) instances. This simulator can perform arbitrary single qubit and controlled-single-qubit gates, as well as other specific gates like `SWAP`.

Any 2x2 bit operator matrices is represented by a list of 4 `complex` floating point numbers, in [**row-major order**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order).

Single and array "`b`" parameters represent [**Pauli operator bases**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices). They are specifiied according to the enumeration of the [`Pauli`](https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack/blob/main/pyqrack/pauli.py) class.

`MC[x]` and `MAC[x]` methods are controlled single bit gates, with as many control qubits as you specify via Python list `c` argument. `MCX` is multiply-controlled Pauli X, and `MACX` is "anti-"controlled Pauli X, i.e. "anti-control" activates the gate if all control bits are specifically **off**, as opposed to **on**.
